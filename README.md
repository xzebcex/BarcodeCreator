# **Barcode Creator**
The Barcode Generator Python script creates an EAN13 barcode picture. It makes use of the barcode module as well as ImageWriter from the barcode.writer module.
Simply modify the number variable to the 13-digit number for which you want to produce a barcode (be sure to send it as a string) and execute the script. The barcode image will be stored in the same directory as the script as a PNG file called "new code1."
This script may be used to generate barcode pictures for products or inventory items that adhere to the EAN13 standard and can be read by most barcode readers.
